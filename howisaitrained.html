  <h1>How is AI trained?</h1>
  <h2>In order for AI to work effectively, lots of data is required to train the algorithm. The data itself has to be clearly labeled and organised, otherwise it may be difficult for the AI to actually learn anything from the data set. Once the training data is acquired, the machine analyzes the data and makes predictions based on all of the data it has seen up to that point. So, it makes initial predictions based on the data set they are given, and then adjusts its predictions to be more precise as it gets more data. Along with the data, you can provide parameters for the AI so the outcome can be as accurate as possible. Once the machine creates its own parameters based on the data, it can apply it to any new data that arrives and make feasible predictions based on all of the data it has trained on. The speed at which AI is trained can vary, as there may be hardware limitations which can greatly increase the amount of time it takes to train an efficient and accurate AI.
