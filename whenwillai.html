  <h1>When will AI surpass human capabilities, and what concerns are rising regarding it?</h1>
  <h2>Many AI experts have predicted that AI will be better than humans at basically everything in the next 50 years. This raises concerns on the rights of these systems, what they should be considered, and the safety of humanity when this “event” happens. As AI becomes more advanced, they may become self-conscious, and start communicating with other machines. At this point, humans lose control over the AI, and its actions are completely decided at its own will.  One consequence of AI is job loss, which is inevitable at the rate at which AI is being trained. There will be a point in the future where an AI will be better than any human at anything, and at that point the job security of every living person will be compromised. There is also a possibility of data abuse, as readily available AI algorithms can be used by third parties to mine information about users without their knowledge.
