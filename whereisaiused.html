  <h1>Where is AI used?</h1>
  <h2>AI is used in most major fields of study today, even if they have little related to technology. AI is used in chatbots and virtual assistants (such as siri), Security, Agriculture, self driving cars and much more. In agriculture, AI drones can be used to monitor the conditions of the crops, and automated machines are used to enhance productivity and crop yield. AI/machine learning has transformed and is continuing to transform the automotive industry. Companies such as Tesla are starting to make self-driving cars a reality, and more and more people are starting to switch to this alternative. AI is also making a huge impact on the healthcare industry by empowering machines to make extremely accurate diagnoses and predictions based on the patient and their condition. AI can truly take the human population to the next level if used correctly, and we are witnessing evolution with our own eyes.
