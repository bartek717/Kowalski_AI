  <h1>What is AI?</h1>
  <h2>AI, at its base level, is simply intelligence demonstrated by machines. Any device that perceives its environment and takes steps towards perfecting the outcome is considered “intelligent”. There are 2 main types of Artificial intelligence. The first is Narrow AI, which we see in most computers, which is an intelligent system that has been taught or has evolved to the point where it can complete a specifically defined task without being programmed how to do so. Most AI systems today are considered “Narrow AI”. General AI (also called strong AI) is much different, and is more similar to the type of intelligence found in humans. General AI can adapt to its surroundings and is able to perform many different tasks based on its experience with other tasks. It applies the knowledge and skills it has acquired and applies it to new situations and tasks that it hasn’t necessarily seen before. In order for General AI to work efficiently, a ton of commuting power is needed. The “next big step” for General AI seems to be quantum computing which exponentially multiplies our computational power.
