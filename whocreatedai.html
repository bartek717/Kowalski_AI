  <h1>Who Created AI?</h1>
  <h2>During WW2, technology advancements were booming. This allowed for computing power to be increased, and for scientists and mathematicians to think of things that were never considered before. By the mid 1950’s, there were many mathematicians and scientists with the idea of Artificial Intelligence. However, they were never able to start working on the concept as the computing power at the time was inadequate, and computers were also extremely expensive. One of these people was Alan Turing, who created the bombe. The very term of “Artificial Intelligence” was coined by John McCarthy in 1956 at a conference which researchers agreed on the significance of Artificial Intelligence. This sparked the next 20 years of computer and machine learning advancements, which have eventually led to the algorithms we know and use today in our daily lives. So, no “one person” created AI, and it was a collaboration of many scientists and math mathematicians.
