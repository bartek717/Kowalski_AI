  <h1>Why do we need AI?</h1>
  <h2>Artificial intelligence has the potential to perfect and enhance human efforts in the world of data and research. Without it, cancer research could be set back decades, and things like self-driving cars would never have become a reality. AI holds the future of research, transportation, data processing and even gaming. It can find patterns in large data sets that humans would never be able to find, and using these correlations can make assumptions and predictions which can impact millions of peoples lives. Currently, AI and machine learning is being used more and more to personalise data and search results. Simply put, our daily lives would not be the same without the use of AI.
